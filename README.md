# the-beginning
This is where everything begins.  Your journey to becoming a programmer.
I dont know what I want to do.  I've worked in the health industry.  I'm currently working in sales at Fry's Electronics.  I love working with computers but dont see a future in computer hardware.  I want to see if programming can be something I can do.
